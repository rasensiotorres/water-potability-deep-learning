# Drinking water potability: Machine Learning classification problem

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements a deep learning binary classification problem with python. 
The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability) and contains 3276 water types classified as potable and non-potable. Each of these water bodies have 9 different features that determine whether the water is indeed potable.

I only included the code here used to pre-process the data and create a machine learning model with Keras.  
A more thorough analysis of the evaluation metrics on this dataset (e.g. confusion matrix followed by ROC/P-R curves) is still to be done.
